# The Odin Project 
v0.0.6

## Empowering Aspiring Developers to Learn Together


This site provides the shell around [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://github.com/theodinproject/curriculum) and the tools that help students to pair together and get to know others who are working on the curriculum.  It has been open-sourced to provide both a learning resource for students who want to see how the tools they're using are built and to give students the opportunity to stretch their wings and contribute to a real open-sourced project... while building the tools they themselves will be using.

Thus far, the code has been more or less hacked together so don't use it as a star example of how things should be done!  We'll be rolling out some better documentation and contribution instructions as this develops a little further.

For minor fixes, either submit a github issue or a pull request.  Please coordinate with the project maintainers if you're interested in working on some of the larger features in order to avoid traffic jams.
