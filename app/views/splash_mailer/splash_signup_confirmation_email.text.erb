    Thank you for your interest in The Odin Project!

    We're really excited that you're with us to help lead the charge towards a
    more collaborative online coding experience.

    The site is going to be changing quickly over the next few weeks and months
    and you will be a key factor in how that happens.  There are a couple ways
    you can help:

    1. Spread the word!  Bring your friends along for the ride by letting them
    know about <%= @odin_url %>.

    2. Send us feedback! We LOVE hearing from people who are learning to program
    online or who have suggestions for the site.  Just look us up at <%=
    @feedback_email %>.

    We'll shortly be inviting more users into the private release, so look out
    for that email as well if you'd like a chance to get on board early.

    Good luck with your coding journey, and we'll see you soon!
