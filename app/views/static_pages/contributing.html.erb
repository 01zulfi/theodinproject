                    The learning curve can be steep at first -- <strong>but don't cut corners!</strong>
                    While you're working through the lessons there, you should start getting your toes wet
                    by observing how this website is being build -- it will give you great context for 
                    what you're learning.

                    add tests to an area that is weak, or just improve comments and documentation (like this page).

              everything from project architecture to major refactorings and implementation
              of industry best practices.

            Web and SaaS development have ever growing needs for web designers who can
            assist in typically more creative roles, such as User Experience (UX),
            User Interface (UI), graphic design, and layout. While certain technical
            aspects are still required, there is a definite emphasis on creativity,
            intuitiveness, and imagination.
