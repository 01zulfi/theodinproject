    <h1>How to Contribute</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>The Odin Project</strong> is crowdsourced.  It is built both by experienced engineers
        and by people who are currently learning to code
        <em>just like you</em>. Regardless of your experience, you can contribute... in fact, 
        we hope you do! Even if you
        don't feel ready, you can still get involved and observe until you're comfortable. Still
        not sure? Here are some <a id="reasonsToggle" href="#" data-toggle = "modal">reasons to get
        involved!</a>
      </p>

    <p><em>
        This guide will help you get started contributing to the Odin Project website (which you're on now!).  
      If you're looking to contribute to the curriculum (for instance to add your solution to one of the projects),
        <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/contributing.md">check out the
          instructions posted here</a> instead.

                    The most common first step for getting actively involved with a new code base is to fix a bug,
                    add tests to an area that is weak, or just improve comments and documentation (like this page).
