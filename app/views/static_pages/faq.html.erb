    <h2 class="faq-question">Who is The Odin Project for?</h2>
    <p>
      The Odin Project is for absolute beginners and those who have tried other resources without success.  In reality, The Odin Project is for anyone who wants to work as a web developer, do freelancing work, build a startup, or just hack together a homepage for yourself.  All the tools you need are here.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve built an in-depth curriculum designed to take you 100% of the way to becoming a web developer. Many other resources out there teach you just the basics of programming.  With The Odin Project you’ll create your own websites, games, and social media sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curriculum has also been designed in a modular fashion, making skimming through lessons a breeze.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">What is the goal of the The Odin Project?</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of The Odin Project is to provide a complete path for students to go from zero to employed as web developers while working with other students along the way.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">How long does The Odin Project take?</h2>
    <p>
      The Odin Project is not a “Learn it all in two days!” program, nor is it a 4 year Computer Science Degree. It’s somewhere in between – depending on you!
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve distilled a Computer Science degree into everything that you need to become employable as a web developer.  It’s a healthy dose of learning and will take roughly 1000 hours of work to complete. If you’re naturally more technical or come from a technical background, it may take less time. If you’re less technical it may take more time.
    </p>
    <p> 
      If you work on The Odin Project full-time 40 hours a week, it’ll take about 6 months. Part time learners can expect to take 12 months to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be most productive, try to set aside long blocks of time.  You are significantly more productive when you “get in the zone” and spend 4-6 hours at a time learning and building projects. 
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">What are you actually teaching?</h2>

    <p>
      The Odin Project assumes you’re new to web development, so we start out by going over what exactly a web developer does in our <%= link_to "Introduction to Web Development", course_path("introduction-to-web-development") %> course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <%= link_to "Web Development 101 course", course_path("web-development-101") %> will give you a chance to explore several of the languages and technologies you’ll need to know on your journey to becoming a web developer.  Web Development 101 introduces HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, Git, databases and more. We’ve also created mini-projects that give you a chance to test your new knowledge by building your own applications and websites!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Odin Project takes a back-to-front approach to learning Ruby on Rails.  We start with a <%= link_to "strong foundation in Ruby", course_path("ruby-programming") %> and an understanding of databases before migrating into <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", course_path("ruby-on-rails") %> (which is a framework built using Ruby).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Odin Project then takes you deep into <%= link_to "HTML and CSS", course_path("html5-and-css3") %>, along with <%= link_to "Javascript, JQuery and Backbone", course_path("javascript-and-jquery") %> to give you all the tools necessary to make websites flow, load quickly, and look great.  Along the way you’ll learn Git and deployment so you can build your own portfolio, collaborate with others, and see your work on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, The Odin Project will teach you to work with legacy codebases and open-source projects. We’ll also cover areas specifically intended to help when you’re <%= link_to "looking for employment", course_path("getting-hired-as-a-web-developer") %>.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">Why Ruby on Rails?</h2>
    <p>
      There are dozens of frameworks and technology stacks to choose from and, frankly, they do pretty much the same thing. Ruby on Rails is attractive because it’s straightforward and well documented.  It’s also used by many tech companies and has a strong community of developers who support it.

    </p>
    <p>
      Rails lets you deploy a functioning website in hours instead of weeks.  Rails also provides a great platform to build the skills you need to carry you to the next phase.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">Who is "Odin"?</h2>
    <p>
      Odin is a figure from Norse mythology, the allfather of the gods. He is portrayed as powerful and fickle (as they often are) but also wise and cunning. His search for knowledge is a thing of legends - he <%= link_to "gave his eye for the wisdom of ages", "http://norse-mythology.org/tales/why-odin-is-one-eyed/" %> and hung from the world tree, pierced by his own spear, for nine days and nights to <%= link_to "gain the knowledge of runes", "http://norse-mythology.org/tales/odins-discovery-of-the-runes/" %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning development is not an easy task and the tools laid out here are merely the path; you must walk it yourself. Should you possess a thirst for knowledge and persistence of spirit akin to that storied in Odin's mythos, you will find success on your journey.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">Where do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t have to!  Dive right in, the content is free and available.  It’d be best if you started at the beginning and went through in order but everyone’s goals are different so we made the full curriculum available if you want to cherry-pick lessons or projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, by <%= link_to "signing up", new_user_registration_path %> you are able to check off completed projects and lessons, easily keeping track of your progress.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">Is The Odin Project free?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes! The Odin Project is an open-source project created and maintained by hard working volunteers. If you want to help please <%= link_to "reach out", contact_path %>.
    </p>



    <h2 class="faq-question">Can I Use This Curriculum To Teach?</h2>
    <p>
      The Odin Project is licensed under two pieces: the curriculum and the main website.  The main website is a fully open-source project <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/blob/master/license.txt">under an MIT license</a>, so you can use the code for whatever you want.  The curriculum is currently licensed under a <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/license.md">Creative Commons license</a> which restricts it to noncommercial use without prior authorization. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This means you can use The Odin Project’s curriculum to teach at your club, meetup, or with your friends (In fact, we’d love it if you did that and told us how it went!). You can’t, however, use it to start a bootcamp without having a conversation first.  Please reach out with any questions to <a href="mailto: contact@theodinproject.com">contact@theodinproject.com</a>
    </p>
