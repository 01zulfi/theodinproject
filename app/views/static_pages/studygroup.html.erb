            <h3>Web Development 101</h3>

            <p>This is a free weekly study group on Sundays at 6pm. We will be working through The Odin Project <%= link_to "curriculum", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses" %> from beginning to end.</p>
    
            <p>During the week, we will be working through the curriculum 
            independently, and completed projects are due on Sunday at our meeting. During our study group meetings, we can show our completed projects, discuss questions, and keep each other motivated.</p>
    
            <p>Parts of the curriculum will appear to be review for some people. Parts of the curriculum will appear to be insurmountable for some people. We will steadily progress, nonetheless.</p>

            <p>If you missed last week's meeting and are still interested in climbing aboard, now is the time! Everyone was still getting up to speed at last week's study group, so we extended the first project through this week.</p>
    
            <p>For many, this looks like review. But it's trickier than it looks and takes longer than you might expect, so start early and work every day.</p>

            <p><strong>Note: </strong>There are 10 spots available in the interactive chat. We will be cycling participants in and out of the interactive chat to go over the project and questions.

            <p>If you try to enter the interactive chat and get a Google server error, copy the link to the chat to your clipboard, log out of Google, paste the url into your browser and go to it, Google will ask for your password, then it should let you in.</p>
    
            <p>If that doesn't work, try the same steps in another browser.</p>

            <h3>The Rails track!</h3>
    
            <p>We will be working through The Odin Project curriculum, 
              starting at the <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails section", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons" %>.
              We'll meet online weekly, go over our efforts, and help answer each others questions.</p>

             <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
             <ul>
               <li>Be comfortable with Git, HTML, CSS, javascript, and especially Ruby code.  If you're not, 
               then you'll want to go through 
                 <%= link_to "Web Dev 101 ", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons" %>
                 and <%= link_to "Ruby ", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons" %>
                 sections.
               </li>
               <li>Read and finish the   
                 <%= link_to "course intro", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work" %>.
               </li>
             </ul>
              
            <p>Compared to a lot of other Rails tutorials, the Odin Rails curriculum covers a wider range of topics 
              - for good reason.  We want to be able to implement our own app ideas, not just follow a cookie-cutter
              recipe.  
             </p>
             
             <h4>Study-group Goals</h4>
             <ul>
               <li>Meet at least weekly to discuss efforts, problems, and their solutions,</li>
               <li>Provide a light at the end of the tunnel!  A schedule to keep to,</li>
               <li>Keep schedule flexible based on participants needs,</li>
               <li>Provide extra value by providing info form outside the curriculum,</li>
               <li>Comradery, and inspiration from fellow devs on the same track,</li>
               <li>and more!</li>
             </ul>
               
            <h4>Schedule</h4>
             <p>Will be posted after the 2nd week.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Seems like there's going to be a bunch of new people.  We will probably backtrack 
              a bit and repeat much of Week 1, especially in regards to installation and environment setup.  
              We'll dive into some HTTP and REST, a little deeper than last time.  And more! ;-)<br>
              Those folks who were there the first week
              can share how long it took them to finish the RailsGuides project and Blogger2.  
            </p>
            
            <h4>Week 2 Curriculum</h4>            
            <p>
              Dive into chapter 2 of Hartl's online tutorial with some extra sauce.

              <strong>This first meeting will be mostly a meet-and-greet, and orientation.</strong>
              Some of us have already built some stuff with Rails, some of us don't yet know the difference 
              between Rails and Ruby; I expect a variety of levels.  Come one, come all.
            </p>
            <p>
              This first week lets go through an exploration of our installation and
              dev environment options, some talk around what we'd all like to get out of the course,
              what kind of time and effort we're willing and able to put into it, and anything else folks
              want to cover.
